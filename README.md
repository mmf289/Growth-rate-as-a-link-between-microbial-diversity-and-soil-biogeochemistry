# Growth rate as a link between microbial diversity and soil biogeochemistry

This repo contains code necessary to recreate Figure 2 in ["Growth rate as a link between microbial diversity and soil biogeochemistry"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-024-02520-7) 

Code to perform additional analyses used in the manuscript is coming soon. If you need additional information in the mean time, please feel free to reach out to me at [megan.foley@unil.ch](megan.foley@unil.ch) 

## Manuscript overview

This manuscript discusses how in situ growth rates of soil microorganisms can be leveraged to advance emerging concepts in soil microbial ecology. In the paper, we synthesize published estimates of growth at the assemblage- and population- levels. Population-level measurements of growth rate were made based on the incorporation of 18</sup>O into bacterial DNA during incubations with isotopically heavy water (H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O).

## Scripts  

1. [Figure 2](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mmf289/Microbial-growth-in-soil/blob/main/docs/Figure-2-markdown.knit.html): Visualizes assemblage- and population-level measurements of microbial growth rates.

a) Published estimates of relative growth rates of soil microbial assemblages in agricultural, forest, grassland and tundra ecosystems. Measurements were made using IRMS-enabled H218O-DNA SIP, H218O-DNA qSIP, thymidine (Tdr) incorporation, leucine (Leu) incorporation, 2H2O-lipid SIP or soil carbon mass balance modelling. The y axis is log transformed. Study information is provided in Supplementary Data 1. 

b) Distribution of relative growth rates of amplicon sequence variants measured by H218O-DNA qSIP in five ecosystems: tropical forest, temperate grassland, temperate conifer forest, boreal forest and moist acidic tundra. The x axis is log transformed. 

c) Distribution of relative growth rates of bacterial and archaeal phyla. The x axis is log transformed. Study information is provided in Supplementary Data 2. In a and c, the middle lines correspond to median values, the lower and upper edges correspond to the first and third quartiles and the whiskers extend to the highest and lowest points within 150% of the interquartile range.
