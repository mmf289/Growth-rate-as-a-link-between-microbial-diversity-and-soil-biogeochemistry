# Growth rate as a link between microbial diversity and soil biogeochemistry

This repo contains code necessary to recreate Figure 2 in ["Growth rate as a link between microbial diversity and soil biogeochemistry"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-024-02520-7) 

Code to perform additional analyses used in the manuscript is coming soon. If you need additional information in the mean time, please feel free to reach out to me at [megan.foley@unil.ch](megan.foley@unil.ch) 

## Manuscript overview

This manuscript discusses how in situ growth rates of soil microorganisms can be leveraged to advance emerging concepts in soil microbial ecology. In the paper, we synthesize published estimates of growth at the assemblage- and population- levels. Population-level measurements of growth rate were made based on the incorporation of 18</sup>O into bacterial DNA during incubations with isotopically heav water (H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O) 

## Data sets

1. [Assemblage-level growth rates of soil microrganisms](https://github.com/mmf289/Growth-rate-as-a-link-between-microbial-diversity-and-soil-biogeochemistry/blob/main/docs/Supplementary%20dataset%201.csv)  (synthesis of published data)

2. Population-level growth rates of soil bacteria (please contact me directly for this data).
