# Microbial-growth-in-soil

This repo contains code necessary to recreate Figure 2 in ["Growth rate as a link between microbial diversity and soil biogeochemistry"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-024-02520-7) 

Code to perform additional analyses used in the manuscript is coming soon. If you need additional information in the mean time, please feel free to reach out to me at ["megan.foley@unil.ch"](megan.foley@unil.ch) 

## Manuscript overview

This manuscript discusses how in situ growth rates of soil microorganisms can be leveraged to advance emerging concepts in soil microbial ecology. In the paper, we synthesize published estimates of growth at the assemblage- and population- levels. Population-level measurements of growth rate were made based on the incorporation of 18</sup>O into bacterial DNA during incubations with isotopically heav water (H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O)
